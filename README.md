# Road Accident Analysis (Excel Dashboard-1)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an Excel Dashboard for analyzing road accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides key insights into accident severity, casualties by vehicle type, road conditions, and monthly trends. It helps in understanding accident patterns and making data-driven decisions.


## 📊 Dataset Information

Source: YouTube road accident dataset

Years Covered: 2021 & 2022

### Key Data Fields:

Accident Date

Vehicle Type

Road Type

Light Condition (Day/Night)

Surface Condition (Dry/Wet/Snow)

Casualties Count (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

Location Details


## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### Before building the dashboard, we cleaned the dataset using the following steps:

Handled Missing Values: Removed or imputed missing accident records.

Standardized Data Formats: Ensured consistency in date, vehicle type, and surface conditions.

Created Derived Columns:

Extracted month & year for trend analysis.

Categorized casualties into severity levels.

Filtered Outliers: Removed anomalies in casualty counts and locations.


## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Casualties Happened After the Accident

Total Casualties & Percentage by Accident Severity and Vehicle Type

Total Casualties by Vehicle Type

Monthly Casualties by Road Type

Comparison of Monthly Casualties (Current Year vs. Previous Year)

Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface Condition

Relationship Between Casualties by Location (Urban/Rural) and Light Condition (Day/Night)


## 🎯 Steps to Create the Excel Dashboard

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation in Excel

Load the dataset into an Excel sheet.

Apply data cleaning steps (as mentioned above).

Use formulas to calculate totals and percentages for key metrics.

### 2️⃣ Pivot Tables for KPI Calculation

Create pivot tables for different categories:

Casualties by Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

Casualties by Vehicle Type

Casualties by Month & Road Type

Casualties by Surface Condition

Casualties by Location & Light Condition

Add calculated fields where needed.

### 3️⃣ Build the Dashboard

Insert charts based on pivot tables:

Pie Charts: Severity-wise casualties, location-wise distribution.

Line Chart: Monthly casualties trend (2021 vs. 2022).

Bar Charts: Casualties by road type & surface condition.

Slicer Filters: For dynamic selection by year, severity, vehicle type, etc.

Format the dashboard with colors, labels, and layout for easy interpretation.
