# Road Accident Analysis (Excel Dashboard-1)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an Excel Dashboard for analyzing road accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides key insights into accident severity, casualties by vehicle type, road conditions, and monthly trends. It helps in understanding accident patterns and making data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Dataset

### The dataset used for this analysis contains information on:

Total casualties

Accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

Vehicle types involved

Road surface conditions

Monthly casualty trends

Location-wise and time-based accident patterns

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### Before building the dashboard, the following steps were taken for data cleaning:

Removing Duplicates – Ensuring unique accident records.

Handling Missing Values – Filling gaps in accident severity or vehicle types.

Standardizing Data – Converting text fields into structured categories.

Adding Calculated Fields – Deriving additional insights like casualty percentages.

Sorting & Filtering – Organizing data for better visualization.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### The dashboard focuses on the following KPIs:

Total Casualties – Overall count of casualties from accidents in 2021 and 2022.

Casualties by Severity – Fatal, serious, and slight casualties with percentage distribution.

Casualties by Vehicle Type – Identifying vehicle types responsible for the most casualties.

Monthly Casualties by Road Type – Understanding accident trends based on road types.

Casualties Trend Analysis – Monthly comparison between 2021 and 2022.

Casualties by Road Surface Condition – Distribution based on dry, wet, or snowy roads.

Casualties by Location & Light Condition – Examining accidents in urban/rural areas and during day/night.

## 🏗 Steps to Create the Excel Dashboard

Load the dataset into Excel.

Clean the data using filters and conditional formatting.

Create pivot tables for each KPI.

Design visual elements such as bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines.

Use slicers and filters to make the dashboard interactive.

Format the dashboard for a clean and professional look.

## 🎯 Insights from the Dashboard

Most casualties occur in urban areas.

Fatal and serious accidents are more common on certain road types.

Casualties increase during night-time and bad weather conditions.

Specific vehicle types are involved in the highest number of accidents.

## 📥 Usage Instructions

Open the Excel file with the dataset and dashboard.

Use filters and slicers to interact with the data.

Analyze trends using the pre-built graphs and pivot tables.

## 📝 Conclusion

This Excel Dashboard helps visualize accident data effectively, allowing users to understand accident severity, trends, and factors contributing to casualties. It is useful for traffic analysts, policy makers, and researchers to improve road safety.
